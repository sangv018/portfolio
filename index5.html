          Process:
          <br>
          I created a webpage that was interactive and was linked to multiple subpages where in each one could display a positive affirmation. The aim of this project was to create a series of 3 unique web pages which focuses on one to three HTML tags each, I wanted to explore with the button, linking pages and background colours being interactive with the audience.

            I first brainstormed ideas to think of how I could implement these ideas into my project in a unique manner and as the prompt suggested the main motive was to create a series of webpages, so I wanted each of them to be different in their own ways. 

            Each affirmation has positive word linking to the next page where another quote is displayed. Making these webpages taught me a lot about alignment and hyperlinking pages as well. Overall it was enriching to put my sketched ideas into code in an interactive manner.
