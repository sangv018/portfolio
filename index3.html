          Process:
          <br>
          I created 2 abstracted webpages that use media queries and are responsive designs, the aim of the project was to create a responsive webpage that can be accessible on all devices without hampering the aesthetic alignment in any way or form.

Both the abstract designs I created are a new version of the Poster house homepage and events page, I recreated them using an orange and blue color palette and rearranging the flexboxes that display each element in a new designed form. Before I coded this, I first designed the webpages on Figma o get a better idea on how to layout and structure my page in a cohesive manner that was user friendly. I explored various colour pallets and how to use flex boxes or grids for my webpages so that the alignment and design structure would better. I learnt how to implement responsive and relative units through this project.
