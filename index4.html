          Process:
          <br>
          For this project of mine I aimed to create a satisfying webpage almost like a virtual fidget toy where the user could navigate around by clicking on the colorful boxes and watch them fall to reveal a hidden image behind. A soothing track plays at the end after all the boxes have fallen to the floor almost like a sense of accomplishment and relaxation. The idea behind this was to make the user focus on the interaction and see how the visual design of the toy provokes a behavior in the user in this case, itâ€™s a satisfying interaction taking place which would make the user keep repeating the action.

        In order to reach this desired website of mine I first had to determine the HTML elements I would need for this interaction to take place and the kind of event listeners the target had to address, I chose to use the clicking interaction as it has a cause-and-effect relationship between the user and the webpage.
