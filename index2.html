                Project One Interactive Realm:
                <br>
         Painting inspired by Piet

          Process:
          <br>
          For this project of mine I chose to take inspiration from one of Pieter Cornelis Mondrians painting and create an interactive digital painting. Pieter Cornelis Mondrian, after 1906 Piet Mondrian, was a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century.  This interactive realm is almost like a game where the user would first see the painting that was created by legendary artist Piet and then create their own using the colour pickers sprawled all over the webpage.

          While coming up with the idea I wanted to explore with colours and the idea of being able to unleash ones create side. The liberty to play around with colours in a structured manner is something I wanted to portray. The process of culminating this webpage taught me how to position and structure html tags and use advanced css commands.
